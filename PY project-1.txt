                                             Rock Paper Scissors Game Using Python Tkinter


#  Introduction :
                          Let’s create a Rock Paper Scissors game (Stone Paper Scissors game) using the Tkinter library of Python.
              I guess we all know about this game . This game is very easy and popular and often played by the children using
              their hands .
                         Basically this is very easy game . In case you don't know what is this game here i go....
              Rock Paper Scisssor is the game with three choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors ) . Two players can play this at a time .
              Each one has to choose from the three options available .

 #  About Game  [RULES]  :
                     In this game actually you are playing with your enemy , which is computer here .
              The rules for playing this game are listed here .
     
               * If one player chooses the rock , and other chooses the scissors , then rock can break the scissors 
                  hence rocks win  .
               * If one player chooses the rock and other people chooses paper , then paper will wrap rock 
                  hence paper wins  .
               * If one player chooses the scissors and other people chooses then ,  paper  then scissor can cut (tore) 
                  the paper hence scissor wins .
              * If in case both select same choises , then no one will win . Both users (computer ) will not gate any  point  .
  

            So basically this is our game and it's rules ......

Code Explaination  : 
                 Take input from user : 
                 The goal here is to ask the user what they would like to choose as an action and then assign that choice to a variable:
    
                 Make Computer choice : 
                 A competitive game of rock paper scissors involves strategy. Rather than trying to develop a model for that, though,
                 you can save yourself  some time by having the computer select a random action. Random selections are a great way 
                 to have the computer choose a pseudorandom value .

                 Determine a Winner
                 Now that both players have made their choice, you just need a way to decide who wins. Using an if … elif … else 
                block, you can compare players’ choices and determine a winner:

                 By comparing the tie condition first, you get rid of quite a few cases. If you didn’t do that, then you’d need to check 
               each possible action for user_action and compare it against each possible action for computer_action. By checking the tie 
                condition first, you’re able to know what the computer chose with only two conditiona checks of computer action .

                 So this is how  we created this ... And this is code explanation (Without adding GUI in the code )

Code Explanation using [GUI]

              First of all, we need to import two libraries into our code, which are tkinter and random.
 Create window for our game name as rock , paper ,scissors .
             Next, we are going to define the global variables that we are going to use in our program. 
 We have four of them for storing the user’s score, computer’s score, user’s choice, and computer’s choice.
             Initially, we set the computer’s score and the user's score into zero . 
Then, we are going to define two methods for converting the user’s choice to a number and vice versa. 
Now, let’s create a function to get the computer’s choice. We use the random library here.
The computer selects a random choice from either rock , paper or scissors .
           Next, we are going to create the most important function in our code, the result function, that determines the winner.
 This function evaluates both user’s and computer’s choices, and based on the comparisons, it picks a winner and updates the scores.
           Then, we are going to define three methods for three different user choices. These methods take the user’s choice, generate a computer’s random choice,
 and passthem into the result function, which we created previously.Also, let’s create a text area for displaying the current choices and current scores of both the 
user and the computer.
Now, let’s build three buttons so that the user can click them to play the game.
Finally RUN inside window of mainloop. 

This is the explanation containing  gui ......

CONCLUSION 
                         From this mini project we came to know about different methods and functions in python.
                         We also learnt about use of tkinter in python we also applied it in our program .
                         We also come to know about different concepts in python . we applied all in our program .

Summary : 
                 Hence from this mini project (Game [rock , paper , scissors ]) .
                 we learnt how to use tkinter in python program then we also learnt different concepts in python .
                 It was really good experience to do the mini project . In such way i concluded here .
